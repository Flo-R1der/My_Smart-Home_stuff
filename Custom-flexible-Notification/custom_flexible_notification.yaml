  name: Custom Flexible Notification
  description: >-
    This Script is a replacement for the `notify.notify` service, but with some considerable extra features, that are solving two main problems:
    
    1. You are getting **Notifications in inconvenient situations**? 
       - Set up zones where you don't want unimportant notifications been delivered and reference them in the blueprint.
          - Examples: work, school, university, gym, ...
       - Once the device leaves the excluded zone, notifications will be delivered as normal
    2. **Going on vacation/business trip** and don't want to get notifications?
       - Create a Helper Toggle-Switch*, reference it in the blueprint and turn it off in the Home Assistant User-Interface. This excludes the device from unimportant notifications going through this script.
          - Examples: empty battery, vacuum robot is stuck, dishwasher or washing machine finished, ...
       - Once the Toggle-Switch is turned on again, notifications will be delivered 
    
    \* I know, there is a way to set up this configuration within the blueprint, without the need of creating an `input_boolean`-Helper. But the automation setup is only accessible for Administrators and not for regular users. In order to make it more accessible I decided to use `input_boolean`-Helper.
    
    
    **NOTE**: The skipped notifications will NOT be queued and delivered after the person leaves the zone or the Switch is turned on again. This means these notifications will simply be discarded for this device at this moment. Of course the device will be reconsidered in the next run of the script, if the switch is turned on again or th person is not in any excluded zone anymore.
    
    
    **Like My Work?** <br>
