# My Smart-Home stuff

Hi all,  
I'm sharing my stuff that accumulated over the past months and years. This includes the following things:

1. **[Custom flexible Notification](Custom-flexible-Notification)**  
   A Home Assistant blueprint, creating a script to manage [Mobile Notifications](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/notifications/notifications-basic) for the Home Assistant Companion App in order to distribute your push-notifications, based on:
   - zones the selected device is in 
   - an input-switch to turn off notifications temporary

2. **[Intel NUC Holder for 10" racks](Intel-NUC-Holder_for_10-inch-Rack)**  
   A 3D printed holder for Intel NUC to operate the device headless and space-saving in a 10" rack.
   - Network, USB and HDMI is full accessible. I also have an USB-C extra as a keystone insert.
   - Device can still be started with a push on the button

3. **[NINA Warnings](NINA-Warnmeldungen)**  
   For sensors from the [NINA Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/nina/): 
   - A Home Assistant blueprint, to **create mobile push-notifications**, based on the severity of the Warning.
   - A markdown-card to provide the warnings via the **Home Assistant Lovelace UI**.
